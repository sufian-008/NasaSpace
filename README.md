## Project Overview

AgroSat Monitor enables users to visualize satellite imagery on a 3D interactive globe, monitor current disaster alerts (wildfires, floods, drought), analyze crop health risks, and simulate real-time notifications. It is built to be engaging and intuitive, with a smooth flow aligned to a 240-second NASA Space Apps presentation framework.

## Key Features

- **Landing & Hero Section:** Engaging introduction with call-to-action.
- **Interactive 3D Globe:** Realistic Earth visualization powered by Three.js with disaster markers and filtering.
- **Dashboard:** Analytics panels with current alerts, risk metrics, and historical trends using Chart.js.
- **Alerts System:** Clickable alert items linked with globe highlights and severity indicators.
- **Team Section:** Showcase of team members with bios and hover effects.
- **Prototype & Impact:** SMS alert simulation and modal for detailed future impact metrics.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptable to desktop and mobile screens.
- **Smooth Navigation:** In-page smooth scroll for seamless presentation flow.

## Presentation Alignment

This frontend is built specifically for the **240 SECONDS OF GLORY** NASA Space Apps challenge structure, breaking down into:

- **WHO** (0–60 sec): Team introduction with bios and visuals.
- **WHY** (60–120 sec): Problem statement detailing disaster and agriculture challenges.
- **WHAT** (120–180 sec): Core solution showcased via the interactive dashboard and globe.
- **HOW** (180–240 sec): Prototype features including live simulations and future impact.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/agrosat-monitor-frontend.git
cd agrosat-monitor-frontend

text

2. **Open the project**

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser or use a static server for better experience.

3. **Optional: Use npm and live-server**

npm install
npm run dev

text

This will start a local development server with live reload on port 3000.
