## Project Overview

The AgroSat Monitor basic prototype is currently under active development as part of our main project. It serves as an initial version that allows users to interact with a 3D satellite globe, monitor disaster alerts, analyze crop health risks, and simulate real-time notifications. This prototype provides a foundation for further enhancements and is designed to guide the development of the full project while demonstrating the core functionality and user experience.
